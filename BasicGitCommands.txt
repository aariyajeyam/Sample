BASIC GIT COMMANDS!

git init	//Initialize Local Git Repository

git add *.<fileExtention> 	//Add files with file extention <fileExtention> 


git status	//Check Status of Working Tree

	git commit -m 'comment'		// This avoids the vim text editor



- To ignore certain files/directories create a file '.gitignore' and add them in there. Remember you would still need to add them to the git Repository

- You must add the new branch to the master 
- To change branches use: git checkout <nameOfBranch>
